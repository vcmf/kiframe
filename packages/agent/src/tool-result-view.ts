// BULKY results are elided. This is the recency-aware replacement for the old
// eager "truncate every result at insertion", which shrank even the just-produced result the
// model still needs (ported from cooldown: keep-last-K, replace-whole with a sentinel).

 * not yet shown — each capped at its tier ({@link SKILL_CEILING_CHARS} for skills,
 * {@link RESULT_CEILING_CHARS} for everything else) if it exceeds it. Older,
 * already-shown bulky results are replaced WHOLE with {@link clearedResultText},
 * keeping the `tool_use ↔ tool_result` pairing.
 *
 * `shownBulky` is the run-scoped "included in a view once" set: a bulky result is
 * kept until it has appeared in one built view, then becomes elidable. So every
 * result is included in a sent view at least once — even when a single turn produces
 * more than K bulky results (parallel tool calls) — while context stays bounded (a
 * result lingers past the window for at most one extra turn). It is the inverse of a
 * "freeze what was seen" set (which would keep results forever and defeat eliding);
 * pass the same set across a run's turns. (A result is marked at build time, so a
 * turn whose model call then throws still counts it seen — harmless: the throw ends
 * the run and the set is per-run.)
 *
 * The returned array reuses the log's message objects for anything kept whole
 * (only elided/capped messages are new) — treat the view as READ-ONLY; callers must
 * not mutate it in place or they'd corrupt the authoritative log. Non-tool messages
 * pass through untouched.
